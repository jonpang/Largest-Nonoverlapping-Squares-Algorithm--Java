/*

Notes:
Data must be formatted correctly
First line contains integer containing number of datasets
Next line contains chip description (rows columns)
Next lines contain chip, R = reserved, F = free
At the end of the description is an empty separating line

Sample Input
2
5 6
R F F F F F
F F R R F F
R R R F F F
F F F F F F
F F F F F F

5 5
R R R R R
F R R R R
F R F R R
R R R R R
R R R R R

Output the two largest unused non-overlapping squares separated by space,
on a separate line for each data set.
Sample Output
9 4
1 1
